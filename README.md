# Listicles
 Listicles Playnite plugin

This is a simple plugin that allows you to maintain and track lists of games.
It is best used in a large library when you want to have "Top 10" lists for example.
 
Install as any plugin:

Download the latest .pext file from the Releases page and run it to install the plugin.

Features:

Create and maintain lists of games in your library.

You can re-order the games inside a Listicle as necessary, as well as the Listicles themselves.

Listicle URLs: When creating a Listicle, an arbitrary URL can be entered that will be associated with that Listicle. This can be any URL, but is intended to be the location of the info that the Listicle is based on. For example, if you create a Listicle based off of a Youtube video, you can enter the video's URL. Each Listicle can have its own URL, and there is a button in the top toolbar that will launch the selected Listicle's URL in your default browser (the selected Listicle is displayed in bold).

Stubs: If a game is not in your library, you can add a "stub", which is just a placeholder entry. Stubs appear in italics in the list and have a default icon.

Notes:

In the top toolbar of the plugin, the icons on the left are all related to individual games in a Listicle, while the icons on the right are all related to Listicles as a whole.

My reason for creating this is to have an easy way to create "Top 10" and "Top 25" games lists from Youtube, and some gaming websites. I can add the games they cover to a Listicle as I watch the video or read the article. Later on, I am then able to open that video or article by clicking the Open Link button in the plugin toolbar in Playnite.

This can also be used to maintain a set of playlists for your games.
